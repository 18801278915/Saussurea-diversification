# Saussurea-diversification
The project aims to gain insights into the drivers of radiating diversification in biodiversity hotspots using Saussurea (Asteraceae) as a case. 

The R scripts include:
a: RPANDA script, modified from the study of Condamine et al. (2018), fiting a series of time- and temperature-dependent likelihood diversification birth-death (BD) models;
b: BAMMtools, provided by Jacob B. Landis, used for diversification rate dynamics after BAMM analysis;
c: DR_statistic, a script to calculate DR statistics from Jetz et al. (2012);
d: ES_SIM_Test, trait dependent tests using ES-SIM (Harvey and Rabosky 2017), including essim.R and essim_DR.R;
e: FiSSE, used for binary traits dependent diversification;
f: GeoHiSSE, provided by Jacob B. Landis for  testing hypotheses about range-dependent diversification processes (Caetano et al., 2018); 
g: HiSSE, a script testing 25 different models in the HiSSE, BiSSE and null framework;
h: Musse, preparing to run MuSSE (Multi-State Speciation and Extinction) on a phylogenetic tree and multi-state character distribution; 
i: QuaSSE, preparing to run QuaSSE (Quantitative State Speciation and Extinction) on a phylogenetic tree and quantitative character distribution; 
j: Rgbif, calculating species area and niche breadth for each species, used for ecological niche driving diversification;
k: TESS_analysis, detecting the abrupt changes in speciation and extinction rates, Retrieved from Condamine et al. (2018);
l: traitDependent_functions
